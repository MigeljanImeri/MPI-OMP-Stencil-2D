# MPI-OMP-Stencil-2D

MPI-OMP-Stencil-2D is the final iteration of a semester long assignment in which we parallelized a base program. This base program simulated the dissipation of heat through a metal plate. Paralellization of this program becomes necessary as the calculations done in the simulation scales quadratically as the metal plate increases in resolution.
